# CS50
CS50 is the popular introductory Computer Science program at Harvard and Yale taught by David J. Malan. It was the largest class for the 2015 fall semester at both universities. Their website is: https://cs50.harvard.edu/
The course has nine psets (psets 0-8), with four psets (psets 1-4) having two versions, hacker and original, with hacker being a harder version designed for those who have a computer science background. This folder has my solutions for psets 1-8 (both versions) along with their descriptions (pset 0 was excluded as it was to create a scratch game, which couldn't be upload to GitHub).
All the psets (except pset 0) were done in CS50 ide, which provides a terminal window along with options to write code. Below are brief descriptions of each pset along with their specifications.

pset 0: Create a Scratch program with specified features. (MIT Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/) 
Specifications: http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html


The programming languages used were: C (psets 1-5), html (psets 6-8), php (psets 6-8), SQL (psets 6-8),
